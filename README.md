# Work-Portfolio
Portfolio Website with inspiration from a Youtube tutorial

This website is a personal project that I am implementing as part of my front-end web development self-learning. I am using it to showcase my skills and experience for documentation purposes and for prospective employers.

It is a single-page web application created using Reactjs and CSS. I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
